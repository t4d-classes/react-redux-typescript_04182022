# Exercise 9

1. Display a history of math operations beneath the buttons in calc tool. You may use a list or table. For each history entry, display the type of operation and the number used to perform the operation. Do not display the result of the operation.

Highly Recommended: Each operation in the list should be an object not just a string with the data in the string.

2. Implement a Clear button. When the clear button is clicked, the input field is set to zero, the result is set to zero and the history is deleted.

3. Add a delete button next to each history entry. When the button is clicked, delete the history entry. Do not update the result.

4. Ensure it works!
